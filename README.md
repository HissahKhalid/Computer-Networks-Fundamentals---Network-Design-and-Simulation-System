# Computer Networks Fundamentals - Network Design and Simulation Framework

This project is developed as part of the Fundamentals of Computer Networks course. It involves designing and simulating a comprehensive network architecture using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network is designed to meet the specific needs of various departments within an organization, incorporating multiple VLANs, routing protocols, and essential services such as DHCP and web servers.

## Features

- **VLAN Implementation**: Separate VLANs are created for different departments, including HR, Sales, Finance, Warehouse, and Factory, to ensure efficient traffic management and security.
- **Routing**: The network utilizes static routing and OSPF protocols to facilitate communication between different network segments.
- **Network Services**: DHCP, Web, and Mail servers are deployed to provide necessary services across the network.
- **Security Measures**: Access control lists (ACLs) and firewall configurations are implemented to protect sensitive data and manage traffic flow.

## Technology Stack
- **Simulation Tool:** Cisco Packet Tracer.
